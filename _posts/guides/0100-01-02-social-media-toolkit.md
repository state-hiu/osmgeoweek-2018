##Topline Messages

OSM GeoWeek 2015 calls on teachers, students, community groups, governments, private sector and map lovers around the world to come together to celebrate geography and make maps with OpenStreetMap, the free and openly editable map of the world.

Mapping is important for humanitarian and development efforts, not just in a disaster.

Anyone with an internet connection can be a volunteer mapper in OpenStreetMap, and you do NOT need to be located in or have specific knowledge of the place you are mapping.
