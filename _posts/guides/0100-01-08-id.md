The iD editor is the de facto, browser-based OpenStreetMap editor. iD is fast and easy to use, and allows mapping from various data sources such as satellite and aerial imageries, GPS, Field Papers or Mapillary.

The iD editor is a great way to edit for small and easy changes that donâ€™t require the advanced features of JOSM (a more advanced mapping editor).

### learnOSM.org has [iD Editor](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/id-editor/) resources in many languages to help you get started.

### learnOSM.org also has a [guide for tracing roads, buildings, water and landuse](http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/remote-tracing/). These are many of the features that you will be asked to collect in the projects found on this site.
