The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the U.S. Government initiative to help save the lives of those suffering from HIV/AIDS around the world. PEPFAR requests assistance to inventory buildings and roads for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs. In Uganda, HIV prevalence is highest in the areas that border Lake Victoria, where HIV prevalence can approach or exceed 20% of the general population. 

This task focuses attention on an area that borders the lake: The Kasensaro Landing Site. Understanding where communities are located and how they are connected by roads is essential to understanding whether HIV/AIDS services are in the right place. The spatial data that emerge from this mapping activity can support our understanding of program coverage, the optimization of supply chains, and the analysis of clinical site-level data.
